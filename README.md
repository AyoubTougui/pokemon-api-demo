# pokemon-api-demo

This project is a demo for the [PokiApi](https://pokeapi.co/) based on [ImadBoumzaoued's](https://github.com/ImadBoumzaoued) [repository](https://github.com/ImadBoumzaoued/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file)

The project is built in ReactJs with the help of a few packages such as :

- react-router-dom for routing
- react-query for data fetching
- axios for HTTP requests
- sass only because of personal preference

Improvements on the projects could be :

- A better UI
- Adaptivity to all possible devices
